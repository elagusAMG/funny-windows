# Funny windows

- I followed a tutorial form WesBos where you can open multiple browser tabs where the screen position and the SVG is being shared across tabs

## Installation
- Run `pnpm i`
- Run `pnpm dev`

## How to use it?
- The page will ask you to allow the browser get access to your camera
- Once you grant access, you will see yourself
- Open different tabs and **see the magic happens!**
